# Lethal League Blaze Angle Tool

For exploring character angles and intersections. Mostly JavaScript and utilizes [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/).

## Notes

* Angles were taken from [Daiotzu's angle guide](https://imgur.com/a/OftNrZ8)
* Stage images with bounding box also provided by Daiotzu
* Added character swing portraits with hitbox/hurtbox boundaries. (Chronor)
